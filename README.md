# PolkaPulse
PolkaPulse is a decentralized Yield-as-a-Service (YaaS) protocol leveraging PVM smart contracts, XCM v5, and Agile Coretime to execute an autonomous, atomic yield loop that harvests DOT staking rewards on the Asset Hub, teleports them trustlessly across parachains via XCM, and deploys them into high-yield DeFi vaults in a single logic flow
